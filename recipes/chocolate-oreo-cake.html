            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This Chocolate Oreo Cake is to die for. Three layers of moist chocolate cake are filled and frosted with chocolaty, Oreo-packed buttercream, plus more Oreos are layered between the cake layers. It’s an Oreo lover’s dream.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <h3>Chocolate cake</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2 cups (260g) all-purpose flour (measured properly)</li>
                        <li>2 cups (414g) sugar</li>
                        <li>3/4 cup (85g) natural unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                        <li>2 tsp baking soda</li>
                        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                        <li>2 large eggs</li>
                        <li>1 cup (240ml) milk</li>
                        <li>1 cup (240ml) vegetable oil</li>
                        <li>1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                        <li>1 cup (240ml) boiling water</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Oreo buttercream</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>3 cups (672g) unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
                        <li>8–9 cups (920g-1035g) powdered sugar</li>
                        <li>3 cups (414g) Oreo crumbs (about 33 Oreos)</li>
                        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                        <li>6–7 tbsp (90ml-105ml) heavy cream</li>
                        <li>pinch of salt</li>
                        <li>12 Oreos, chopped</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Chocolate ganache</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>6 oz (1 cup | 169g) semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) heavy whipping cream</li>
                        <li>Oreos, optional</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>NOTE: You’ll need at least one full package of Oreos. If you plan to decorate the outside of the cake with more Oreos, as shown, you might need a second package.</p>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare three 8 inch cake pans with parchment paper circles in the bottom, and grease the sides.</li>
                    <li>Add all dry ingredients to a large bowl and whisk together.</li>
                    <li>Add eggs, milk and vegetable oil to the dry ingredients and mix well.</li>
                    <li>Add vanilla to boiling water and add to mixture. Mix well.</li>
                    <li>Divide batter between three cakes pans and bake at 300 degrees for about 30-33 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with a few crumbs.</li>
                    <li>Remove cakes from oven and allow to cool for about 10 minutes, then remove to cooling racks to cool completely.</li>
                    <li>Make icing while cakes cool. Beat together butter until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Slowly add 4 cups of powdered sugar and mix until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Add vanilla, Oreo crumbs and salt and mix until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Add another 4-5 cups of powdered sugar and mix until smooth. Add heavy cream, as needed, until you get a smooth consistency.</li>
                    <li>Set aside about 3 1/2 cups of icing for the filling inside the cake and add chopped Oreos, if using.</li>
                    <li>Once cakes are cool, remove cake domes from top with a large serrated knife.</li>
                    <li>Place first layer of cake on cake plate. Spread 1/2 of the icing with the chopped Oreos on top in an even layer.</li>
                    <li>Add second layer of cake and add the rest of the of icing with chopped Oreos on top in an even layer.</li>
                    <li>Add final layer of cake on top and frost the outside of the cake with remaining frosting.</li>
                    <li>To make the chocolate ganache, add the chocolate chips to a medium sized bowl</li>
                    <li>Heat the heavy whipping cream just until it begins to boil, then pour it over the chocolate chips. Allow it to sit for 2-3 minutes, then whisk until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Drizzle the chocolate ganache around the edge of the cake, then pour the remainder of the ganache on top of the cake and spread evenly. I like to use a squeeze bottle for drizzling around the edges.</li>
                    <li>Allow the ganache to firm up a bit, then pipe the remainder of the frosting around the top edge of the cake (see my tips on making a chocolate drip cake) and add an Oreo between each swirl. I used Ateco tip 844.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle a few Oreo crumbs onto to the cake, if desired, then serve. Cake is best when well covered for 3-4 days.</li>
                </ol>
            <p>NOTE: Feel free to reduce the overall amount of buttercream if you plan on decorating your cake differently. I use a fair amount based on my method of how to decorate a smooth cake (linked in the recipe instructions above).</p>
