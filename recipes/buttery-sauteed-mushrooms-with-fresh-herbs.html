            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Covering the mushrooms for the first few minutes of cooking helps them release their liquid and brown more quickly. Once uncovered, the liquid evaporates, and the mushrooms begin to brown. The result (which is extra umami-rich thanks to the addition of coconut aminos) is a succulent, versatile batch of mushrooms that can be served as a side dish; they could also be spooned over steak, or stirred into hot pasta for an easy dinner.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                    <li>1 ¼ pounds mixed fresh mushrooms (such as oyster, hen-of-the-woods, beech, cremini, and shiitake), cut or torn into bite-size pieces (about 5 1/2 cups)</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste </li>
                    <li>3 garlic cloves, gently smashed</li>
                    <li>2 thyme sprigs</li>
                    <li>1 rosemary sprig</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoon (1 1/2 ounces) dry white wine</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon coconut aminos or soy sauce</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
                    <li>Black pepper, to taste</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat 2 tablespoons butter and oil in a large skillet over medium until butter melts.</li>
                    <li>Stir in mushrooms and salt; cover and cook, undisturbed, until mushrooms release their liquid, about 4 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Uncover and add garlic, thyme, and rosemary. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is evaporated and mushrooms are browned and tender, about 6 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Stir in wine; cook, stirring occasionally, until evaporated, about 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Stir in coconut aminos and lemon juice; cook, stirring occasionally, until almost evaporated, about 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Stir in remaining 1 tablespoon butter; cook until butter is melted and mushrooms are glossy, about 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Remove from heat. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                </ol>
